# httpbin

[httpbin](http://httpbin.org/) is a simple HTTP Request & Response Service created by [Kenneth Reitz](https://kennethreitz.org/).

It exposes all kind of test and example endpoints that you can use to test your HTTP clients. 

Here at Kong we use httpbin for the majority of our tests and example use cases. Especially the */anything* endpoint is very useful for testing as it echos back all request data.
